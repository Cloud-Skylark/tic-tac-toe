# About the Repository:
  This repository contains a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in the C programming language.
  It allows two players to take turns, competing to win the game by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their respective marks (‘X’ or ‘O’) on a 3x3 grid.

  $ git clone 

# 2) Navigate to the project directory:
  $ cd tic-tac-toe-c

# 3) Build the game using your C compiler:
  $ gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe

# How to Play:
  Run the game by executing the compiled executable:
  $ ./tic_tac_toe

Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns, entering the row and column where you want to place your mark (‘X’ or ‘O’).
The game will check for a win or a draw after each move and display the result.
